# == Define autofs::map::entry
#
# Add an entry to the map specified in $name.
#
# The map file will be created as /etc/autofs/$target.map.
#
# You will need to create an appropriate map::master entry for this to
# be activated.
#
# For additional details see autofs(5)
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*name*]
#   Type: String
#   In this case, $name is mapped to the 'key' entry as described in
#   autofs(5). However, the special wildcard entry '*' is specified by
#   entering the name as 'wildcard-<anything_unique>'.
#
# [*target*]
#   Type: String
#   The name of the map file under which you would like this entry
#   placed.
#
# [*ensure*]
#   Type: ['present','absent']
#   Whether to add or delete the target file.
#
# [*options*]
#   Type: String
#   The NFS options that you would like to add to your map.
